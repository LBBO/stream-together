# Welcome to Stream together üëã

> Stream any video together with friends without worrying about synchronization

## Install plugin

Head to [Stream together's page on the Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stream-together/jkhdbmnngbiiogknojpnddmemomgjpjg)
and follow the usual steps to install the plugin!

If you're using a pre-existing backend, you can skip the next step.

## Install Server

Clone this repository to your server.
To install the dependencies, run

```sh
npm install
```

Now you can start the server with

```sh
npm run devServer
```

‚ö† Attention: Webstorm (for some reason) will not execute this script correctly
in WSL. It needs to be executed via the shell (integrated shell is fine), but
the Run tab won't do it.

## üöÄ Usage

If your server is not running on `localhost:3000`, you'll need
to open the plug-in options and set the backend URL to your backend's URL.

There are three possibilities to get to the plug-in options:

1. Click on the plug-in logo and then on the gear wheel in the top right corner.
2. Right-click on the plug-in logo (or click on the extensions button - which looks like a
   puzzle piece - and then on the three dots) and choose "Options"
3. Visit [Chrome's extensions page](chrome:///extensions), click on "Details" for stream-together
   and then click on "Extension options"

### Creating a session

With everything set up, just visit a website with a video on it. You can then press on the plugin's
logo and a popup will appear. You can now create a new session. This will often modify your URL
by adding a random string after a `#`. The new URL might look something like this:

```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ#19b9cdee-961e-4d1d-b0e9-07fe6f35ca32
```

This link can now be shared with your friends to watch the video together! If your link hasn't been
modified, you will need to share the link and session ID separately. The session ID can be found in the
same popup you used to create the session.

It isn't always added automatically, as it can cause some websites
to break (such as Disney Plus, currently). I am looking for a better solution but suggestions are
always welcome!

### Joining a session

Open the link you were sent. If it already contains the session ID (see [_Creating a session_](#creating-a-session)) your
videos should sync up automatically (if it doesn't, just copy the session ID and pretend it was sent to you separately).
If you received a session ID separately, click on the plugin's
logo and paste the session ID into the input field. After it has been validated, you will be able to
click on `Join Session` and your videos will be synced up from there on.

### Leaving a session

You automatically leave your session when the tab closes. To leave it without closing the tab, just
click on the plugin's logo and use the `Leave session` button.

## Run tests

```sh
npm test
```
